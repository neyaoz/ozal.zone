## Cloudflare + APNIC

`1.1.1.1` is a partnership between Cloudflare and APNIC. Cloudflare runs one of the world’s largest, fastest networks. APNIC is a non-profit organization managing IP address allocation for the Asia Pacific and Oceania regions.

Cloudflare had the network. APNIC had the IP address (1.1.1.1). Both of us were motivated by a mission to help build a better Internet. You can read more about each organization’s motivations on our respective posts: [Cloudflare Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/) / [APNIC Blog](https://labs.apnic.net/?p=1127).

## OpenDNS (Cisco)

OpenDNS is the name of a Domain Name System (DNS) service as well as of the company that provides that service. The OpenDNS service extends the DNS by incorporating features such as content filtering and phishing protection. It is also touted as faster, more reliable and having zero downtime because of its global network of DNS servers that ensures that, if one or two servers are down, the others can still carry the slack.
